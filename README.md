# Mesonet-Cattle-Comfort-index
### Background/Objective:
I am very interested in the cattle/livestock business and know several people that work in this industry., if any, for the following attributes listed below and prepare the data, from different sources, for further analysis and reporting. I was particularly interested in correlations relating to NAICS 722 - Food services and drinking places. Do any of these attributes positively or negatively correlate? What is the strength of the correlation? Is there multicollinearity and if so how strong is it?  What do the relationships look like visually? Are there any outliers?

I thought would be interesting to automate the calculation of the Cattle Comfort Index values based on the formula provide by Mesonet.

__FORMULA__
The Mesonet Cattle Comfort Advisor model was developed and introduced as the Comprehensive Climate Index by Terry L. Mader and Leslie J. Johnson at the University of Nebraska and John B. Gaughan at the University of Queensland in Gatton, Australia.
(Reference: A comprehensive index for assessing environmental stress in animals. 2010.T.L. Mader, Leslie J. Johnson and John B. Gaughan. Journal of Animal Science 2010,Volume 88: pages 2153-2165. The formula was corrected as Erratum in Journal of Animal Science 2011, Volume 89: page 2955. The 2011 corrected formula is included here.)

In addition to understanding and analyzing the correlations, I wanted to think through some hypothetical business cases where a potential regression or classification model could be leveraged for identifying underserved markets where an organization/individual might invest in or launch a food service, where to advertise or sell advertising, where to target your staff training service, where to set up your distribution operations, and how to better invest your time, capital, and other resources.

__Attributes__
